            <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
            <h2>Hi, I'm Anshuman Mani Tripathi</h2>
            <h4>Learner & Inventor</h4>
            <h3>D.O.B 12-09-1999</h3>
            <h5><p>I'm Anshuman Mani Tripathi. I was born and raised in Nautanwa, Maharajganj, Uttar Pradesh. In the year 2020, I earned my diploma in electrical engineering from E-max Polytechnic College under the HSBTE board in the Indian state of Haryana. I'm constantly trying to innovate and learn new things. For instance, during my diploma programme, I completed numerous projects and activities in addition to a two-month internship in a variety of fields.</p> <br>


                <p> The design and simulation of programmable logic controllers based on the detection and removal of burn chips are used in projects like home automation as well as activities like constructing extension boards and understanding plate earthing ideas. Although I completed my first internship in basic electrical engineering at Enerzio Company, I completed my second internship at Infowiz Software Solution Company in the areas of automation (PLC) and embedded systems. Additionally, on the first and tenth days, I visited industrial facilities and had experiences with a variety of businesses, including the beverage company Mango Tree and the Nessler Electronic and Scientific Equipment Company.</p> <br>
               
                <p>  At Jain Deemed University in Bangalore, Karnataka, I am currently pursuing a degree in robotics and automation engineering. I received two certificates during this academic year and published research papers in 2020. I earned my first certificate by publishing a research paper, my second certificate by participating in an AWS webinar in the third trimester, and my third certificate by completing a PCL project in agriculture in the fifth semester. I received two certifications this semester. The first certification is based on passing an online course on edge computing, and the second certification I received was as a result of attending a webinar on the latest advancements in wi-fi technology, digital image processing, and image processing techniques.</p> <br>
               
                <p> Autonomous Garbage Carrying Robot and Hydroponic Farming are the two projects I'm currently working on. I decided to major in robotics and automation for two reasons. First and foremost, I have a strong desire to learn new things and develop new ideas. The second reason was that I visited numerous industries. Through these visits, we learned about the current state of industrial companies and what is expected to happen in the near future. As a result, I decided that a career in robotics and automation was appropriate. All about me, then.</p></h5>
